RockPaperScissors

Description - This project is coded version of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors that would be played by many people in person. I used numbers to represent the different option a person could choose in the game and wanted to make the code as condensed as I could.

Dependencies - I used eclipse to execute the program

Uses - For people to enjoy a classic game with a new take on it

Future Developement - Most of the future updates to this would be to add a way of tracking scores, a timer, and some way of it infinitely looping through the game without having to rerun the entire program every tieme.
